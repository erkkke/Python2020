## Lab 2

### Exercise 1

Create a function that returns element at index `i` in input list. 

Sample input:
```python
# index = 3
exercise_1([10, 3, 4, 5, 9], 3)
exercise_1([10, 3, 4, 5, 9], 4)
```

Sample output:
```python
5
9
```

### Exercise 2

Create a function that collects only values with even index from a given list

Sample input:
```python
exercise_2([10, 3, 4, 5, 9])
exercise_2([9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9, 16])
```

Sample output:
```python
[10, 4, 9]
[9, 12, 4, 9]
```

### Exercise 3

Create a function that mutates elements to square after given index. Elements *before* given index do not change.

Sample input:
```python
# index = 4, all numbers after index 4 should change to their squares
# [..., 4, 5, 9] -> [..., 4 * 4, 5 * 5, 9 * 9]
exercise_3([10, 3, 4, 5, 9], 2)
exercise_3([9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9, 16], 6)
```

Sample output:
```python
[10, 3, 16, 25, 81]
[9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 81, 256]
```

### Exercise 4

Create a function that reverses a given list.

Sample input:
```python
exercise_4([10, 3, 4, 5, 9])
exercise_4([9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9, 16])
```

Sample output:
```python
[9, 5, 4, 3, 10]
[16, 9, 56, 4, 3, 12, 0, 9]
```

### Exercise 5

Create a function that deletes elements after given index.

Sample input:
```python
#index = 2
exercise_5([10, 3, 4, 5, 9], 1)
exercise_5([9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9, 16], 7)
```

Sample output:
```python
[10]
[9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9]
```

### Exercise 6

Create a function that inserts elements at given index and then deletes elements after given index.

Sample input:
```python
#index insert = 2, index delete from = 4, elements to insert = [1, 2, 3]
exercise_6([10, 3, 4, 5, 9], 3, 4, [1, 2, 3])
exercise_6([9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9, 16], 7)
```

Sample output:
```python
# [1, 2, 3] are inserted in position 2 -> [10, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 9]
# elements at index 4 are deleted -> [10, 1, 2, 3]
[10]
[9, 0, 12, 3, 4, 56, 9]
```

## Tuples

### Exercise 7

Given three variables, a, b and c, swap them without using temporary variables.

Sample input:
```python
# a = 5, b = 3, c = 2
(5, 3, 2)
('Hi', 'Ola', 'xD')
```

Sample output:
```python
# a = 2, b = 5, c = 3
(2, 5, 3)
('xD', 'Hi', 'Ola')
```

### Exercise 8

Create a function that returns both minimum and maximum value of given list.

Sample input:
```python
exercise_8([10, 2, 5, -3, -1])
exercise_8([5, 2, 8, 4])
```

Sample output:
```python
(-1, 10)
(2, 8)
```

### Exercise 9

Create a function that returns True, if given tuple contains mutable element.

Sample input:
```python
exercise_9((10, 2, 5, [4, 8, 2], 3, 5))
exercise_9((5, 2.5, 8, 4, 'Hi', -5, True, 6))
```

Sample output:
```python
#Element at index 3 is list that can be changed
True
#All elements of given tuple are immutable objects
False
```

## Sets

### Exercise 10

Create a function that returns set with neighbor numbers of given set.

Sample input:
```python
exercise_10({1, 5, 9})
exercise_10({2, 5, 7, 8, 10})
```

Sample output:
```
{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
{1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11}
```

### Exercise 11

Create a function that returns difference of given 2 sets.
(The difference of sets A,B consists of elements that are in A but not in B).
  
Sample input:
```python
#A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 5, 7}
exercise_11({1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 5, 7})
exercise_11({12, 15, 16, 20, 95}, {1, 2, 3, 16, 17, 20})
```

Sample output:
```
{1, 2, 4}
{12, 15, 95}
```

### Exercise 12

Create a function that returns a set with values from given list, if some number already exists in the set, take it to the power of two, three ... while it's in the set.

Sample input:
```python
exercise_12([1, 2, 2])
exercise_12([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])
```

Sample output:
```
{1, 2, 4}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 16}
```

### Exercise 13

Create a function that returns Yes, if there can be formed palindrome text using given list of number, or No, if there is no way to make a palindrome. 

Sample input:
```python
exercise_13([1,2,3,4,1])
exercise_13([1,2,3,1,2])
```

Sample Output:
```
No
Yes
```

### Exercise 14

Create a function that returns list of numbers from the given list, that are more than given number N;

Sample input:
```python
exercise_14([11,2,44,23], 10)
exercise_14([1,200,45,-67], 45)
```

Sample Output:
```
{11,44,23}
{200}
```

### Exercise 15

Create a function that returns number of odd numbers that are on even positions;

Sample input:
```python
exercise_15([0,3,11,2,44,23,4])
exercise_15([22,23,24,33,34,35])
```

Sample Output:
```
2
3
```

## Lab 3
```
1. Your current location is disk C directory.

2. Each time there are two options: you are either work with directory, or with file.

3. If your current location is file you have several options:

a) delete file

b) rename file

c) add content to this file

d) rewrite content of this file

e) return to the parent directory

4. If your current location is directory you have several options:

a) rename directory

b) print number of files in it

c) print number of directories in it

d) list content of the directory 

e) add file to this directory

f) add new directory to this directory

Your task is to write program that will simulate this repeatable process
